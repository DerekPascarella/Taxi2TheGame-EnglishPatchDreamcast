.------------::[ v1.0 Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| As far as I can tell, "Taxi 2 - The Game" is the only French-exclusive
| Dreamcast title to ever exist.  This alone gives this title historic
| significance and in my eyes, made it worth translating into English.  By most
| measures, this isn’t a great game.  However, fans of the film will enjoy
| the (now English-subtitled) FMVs and the overall narrative.
|
| From a technical perspective, translating this game wasn’t particularly
| challenging due to the data formats that Blue Sphere and Ubisoft chose to
| use.  The fact that this is also a Windows CE game and saw a PC release, too,
| also helped.
|
| The area I required significant outside assistance with were the FMVs, all of
| which contain spoken French dialog.  A huge "thank you" goes out to Prof_gLX
| and Vince for painstakingly transcribing the French dialog from the FMVs and
| then translating/localizing it into English.  Without assistance from one or
| more French speakers, there is no way this would have been possible.
|
| Furthermore, my hat goes off to the wonderful beta testers who had the time
| and patience to not only play the game through, but also report details on
| any and all issues/bugs that they encountered.  Those beta testers are
| Zack (MýnÆnglishTáwk) and LastCat.  Without the efforts of these two, this
| release would not have been possible.  Or, at best, it would have been
| massively delayed.
|
| It's worth noting that there are a few instances where short audio clips of
| spoken French play during each level, and for now these will stay as is.  I
| have no intentions of hiring voice actors, and currenty I'm not able to
| display subtitles on screen during those moments.
|
| The only other untranslated aspect to this game is a warning message that pops
| up when driving the wrong direction.  The message is in French ("Mauvaise
| Direction") and try as I might, I was unable to successfully locate this text
| and/or asset to make the necessary modifications.
|
| I would also like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Patrick "TraynoCo"
| Traynor for re-encoding all of the FMVs with English subtitles.  Your
| contribution was huge!
|
| In closing, there is really only one French item left untranslated as of
| writing this, and that’s the "Mauvaise Direction" (wrong direction) message
| that pops up if your car starts going off-path during gameplay.  As of now, I
| have been unable to locate this asset in order to translate it.  To be
| honest, this will likely remain untranslated, as I have no immediate plans to
| do another release of this game unless some major issues are discovered now
| that it’s out in the wild.
|
| With all of that being said, I hope you enjoy this strange and noteworthy
| game!
